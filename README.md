## Welcome to my humble GitHub profile. Make yourselves at home!

My name is Pedro and I'm a 20-year-old student currently in my sixth semester of graduation. Since I'm majoring in Information Systems, my interests are naturally skewed towards technology, problem solving and all different sorts of innovation. I look forward to learning a whole lot with GitHub!
